The course begins with Ghidra installation and project creation, then moves on to cover all of the default Ghidra displays to understand how they can help you in your reverse engineering efforts. Fundamental concepts such as parameter passing and stack frame are covered using binaries from a variety of architectures in order to understand various Ghidra displays and analysis capabilities. Ghidra’s handling of complex data types is covered from both the disassemblers and the decompilers point of view. The course conclude with a discussion of configuring and using the Ghidra collaboration server, and an introduction to Ghidra scripting. No previous Ghidra or reverse engineering experience is assumed.",
